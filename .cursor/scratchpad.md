# Slacker CLI Project - Planning & Execution Tracker

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal:** Build a command-line interface (CLI) Slack client called "Slacker" implemented in Go using the Bubble Tea framework. The primary feature is exporting Slack channel histories, including threads, into structured JSON files.

**Key Value Proposition:** 
- Intuitive text-based user interface for Slack interaction
- Complete channel history export with thread structure preservation
- Secure OAuth2 authentication and token management
- Efficient handling of large channel histories

**Target Users:** Developers, system administrators, and power users who prefer command-line tools and need to export Slack data for archival, analysis, or migration purposes.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Slack API Integration:** Implementing OAuth2 flow and managing API rate limits
2. **Thread Structure Preservation:** Maintaining parent-child relationships in exported JSON
3. **TUI Complexity:** Creating an intuitive interface with Bubble Tea for navigation and interaction
4. **Performance:** Efficiently handling large channel histories without memory issues
5. **Security:** Secure token storage and management

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Clean Architecture:** Separating concerns with internal/api, internal/usecase, internal/ui layers
- **Modular Design:** Using cmd/ pattern for CLI commands (root, channels, export)
- **State Management:** Bubble Tea model pattern for UI state
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for API failures and network issues

## Lessons

### Development Guidelines:
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Include debugging information in program output
- Read files before editing them
- Run `npm audit` if vulnerabilities appear (though this is a Go project)
- Ask before using force commands in git

### Technical Notes:
- Go version requirement: >= 1.22
- Bubble Tea for TUI framework
- Standard library for JSON handling
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
